# Run the GNU upstream test suite for diffutils against a local build of the
# Rust implementation, print out a summary of the test results, and writes a
# JSON file ('test-results.json') containing detailed information about the
# test run.

# The JSON file contains metadata about the test run, and for each test the
# result as well as the contents of stdout, stderr, and of all the files
# written by the test script, if any (excluding subdirectories).

# The script takes a shortcut to fetch only the test suite from the upstream
# repository and carefully avoids running the autotools machinery which is
# time-consuming and resource-intensive, and doesn't offer the option to not
# build the upstream binaries. As a consequence, the environment in which the
# tests are run might not match exactly that used when the upstream tests are
# run through the autotools.

# By default it expects a release build of the diffutils binary, but a
# different build profile can be specified as an argument
# (e.g. 'dev' or 'test').
# Unless overriden by the $TESTS environment variable, all tests in the test
# suite will be run. Tests targeting a command that is not yet implemented
# (e.g. cmp, diff3 or sdiff) are skipped.
